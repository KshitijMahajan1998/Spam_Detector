# Spam_Detector

Our primary task is to develop a classification model or generative AI application to distinguish between legitimate (non-spam) and spam messages.
I propose three approaches to develop our spam detection model.

### Traditional machine learning classification models
Logistic Regression 

Random Forest

XGBoost

Stacked Classifier

### Deep Learning technique
RNNs : LSTM model

### Large Language Models
RoBERTa : BERT-like LLM

MistralAI : GenAI LLM 7B parameters
